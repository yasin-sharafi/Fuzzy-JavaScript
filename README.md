The fox is looking for a rabbit with her eyes closed-Fuzzy system
In this program, in 100 by 100 coordinates, a fox is looking for a rabbit. But the rabbit is not smart. And it moves randomly. While the fox is intelligent and moves properly to reach the rabbit.So that the environment can be closed or open. If it is closed, the rabbit will be hunted faster. And if the environment is open, both exit the environment
Development intelligence in rabbits can be the next goal.If we achieve this goal, it is better to make the fox smarter.And that could be the next goal.
